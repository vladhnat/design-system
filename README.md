# Design System

A design system built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS for creating consistent, accessible, and responsive user interfaces.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** 16 - React framework with App Router
- **React** 19 - UI library
- **Tailwind CSS** 4 - Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The page auto-updates as you edit files in the `app` directory.

## Testing

Test cases for the design system are documented in [`test-cases.txt`](test-cases.txt). The test suite covers:

- Page structure and layout verification
- Component display and functionality
- Responsive design (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Dark mode theme support
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, alt text)
- Performance (image loading, font rendering)
- Cross-browser compatibility

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy this Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).
